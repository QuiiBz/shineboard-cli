# ShineBoard CLI
## The CLI for ShineBoard - A Beautiful way to share code

ShineBoard is a open-source platform to make sharing code easier. Wasted by all the .txt files you downloaded and the poor hastebin codes ? Switch now to ShineBoard :
* Type `shine help` to get started
* To upload very quicly, run `shine add <file>`
* You can also choose to specify a name for this paste with the flag `--name` (or `-n`) 
* If you which, you can force the language with `--language` (or `-l`) 

Alternatively, you can use the [web application](https://github.com/ShineBoard/shineboard) to create paste from the web.
